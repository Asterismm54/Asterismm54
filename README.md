I am a fan of projects such as OpenBSD, FreeBSD, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, QGIS, OSCAR EMR, OpenSSL, Hadoop, Spark, LibreOffice, CentOS, Inkscape, Firefox the list goes on.. I support FOSS projects in different ways.

In addition to the FOSS and GIS inclinations, I have an interest in population health data analysis, health data management, and health information systems.  I work at a hospital.

Are you creating a proof of concept for a health-focussed open source project? Try: generatedata.com to generate dummy data for your project.
